SUBJECTIVE: The patient is an 89-year-old lady. She actually turns 90
later this month, seen today for a short-term followup. Actually, the main
reasons we are seeing her back so soon which are elevated blood pressure and
her right arm symptoms are basically resolved. Blood pressure is better even
though she is not currently on the higher dose Mavik likely recommended. She
apparently did not feel well with the higher dose, so she just went back to
her previous dose of 1 mg daily. She thinks, she also has an element of office
hypertension. Also, since she is on Mavik plus verapamil, she could switch
over to the combined drug Tarka. However, when we gave her samples of that she
thought they were too big for her to swallow. Basically, she is just back on
her previous blood pressure regimen. However, her blood pressure seems to be
better today. Her daughter says that they do check it periodically and it is
similar to today
