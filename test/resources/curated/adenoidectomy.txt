ADENOIDECTOMY

PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room suite,
anesthesia administered via endotracheal tube. Following this the patient was
draped in standard fashion. The Crowe-Davis mouth gag was inserted in the oral
cavity. The palate and tonsils were inspected, the palate was suspended with a
red rubber catheter passed through the right nostril. Following this, the
mirror was used to visualize the adenoid pad and an adenoid curet was seated
against the vomer. The adenoid pad was removed without difficulty. The
nasopharynx was packed. Following this, the nasopharynx was unpacked, several
discrete bleeding sites were gently coagulated with electrocautery and the
nasopharynx and oral cavity were irrigated. The Crowe-Davis was released.

The patient tolerated the procedure without difficulty and was in stable
condition on transfer to recovery.
