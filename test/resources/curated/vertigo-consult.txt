The patient's main complaint is vertigo. The patient is having recurrent
attacks of vertigo and imbalance over the last few years with periods of free
symptoms and no concurrent tinnitus or hearing impairment. She had previous
normal MRI examination

Assessment for peripheral vestibular function follows:  
 OTOSCOPY: showed bilateral intact tympanic membranes with central Weber
test and bilateral positive Rinne.  
 ROMBERG TEST: maintained postural stability.  
 FRENZEL GLASSES EXAMINATION: no spontaneous, end gaze nystagmus.  
 HEAD SHAKING: No provocation nystagmus.  
 DIX-HALLPIKE: showed no positional nystagmus excluding benign paroxysmal
positional vertigo.  
 VESTIBULOCULAR REFLEX [HALMAGYI TEST]: showed corrective saccades giving
the impression of decompensated vestibular hypofunction.

IMPRESSION: The patient was advised to continue her vestibular
rehabilitation exercises and the additional medical treatment of betahistine
at 24 mg dose bid.

PLAN: Planned for electronystagmography to document the degree of
vestibular hypofunction.
