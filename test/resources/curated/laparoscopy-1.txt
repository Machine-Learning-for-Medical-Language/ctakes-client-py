The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner for an
abdominoperineal procedure. We began with preparation of the patient by
placing a weighted speculum in the posterior vaginal vault. The cervix was
grasped with a single-tooth tenaculum. The uterus was gently sounded and a
manipulator was inserted for movement of the uterus throughout the case. A
Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder to drain the bladder. Attention
was then turned to the abdomen where an incision was made. This incision was
in the umbilicus and was of small caliber-3 mm-in order to allow insertion of
the micro-laparoscopic trocar. Three liters of carbon dioxide gas was used to
insufflate the abdominal cavity and the micro-laparoscopic trocar was
inserted. Then, as noted above, the trocars were inserted into the lower
abdominal area as noted in the findings above. Using pelviscopic instruments,
all of the above procedures were carried out in the usual manner. The patient
tolerated the procedure very nicely. Video documentation was performed
throughout. With termination of the procedure, all instruments were removed
and the trocar sites were inspected. All 12-mm trocar sites were closed in the
fascial layer with #0 Vicryl suture. The 5-mm and 10-mm trocar site incisions
were closed with #4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated
the operation nicely. The instruments were removed from the pelvic cavity. She
was then awakened and taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.
