Doctor's Address

Dear Doctor:

This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you
in the near future. He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar
cerebral palsy and hypotonia. He has been treated by Dr. X through the
pediatric neurology clinic. He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was
having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his
speech problems. She also noted and confirmed that he has significant
tonsillar hypertrophy. The concern we have is whether he may benefit from
surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his
swallowing and speech. Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter.

For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two
sprays to each nostril once a day. He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day
with only partial relief of the symptoms. He does have an allergy to
penicillin.

I appreciate your input on his care. If you have any questions regarding,
please feel free to call me through my office. Otherwise, I look forward to
hearing back from you regarding his evaluation.
