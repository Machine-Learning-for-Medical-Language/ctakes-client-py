The patient was identified. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure
were discussed with the patient. The patient understood, was consented,
brought in the procedure room, and connected to the appropriate monitoring
devices. Versed and fentanyl were given in divided doses. After appropriate
sedation was achieved, a digital rectal examination was done and was normal. A
well-lubricated colonoscope was then inserted and advanced under direct
visualization to the level of the cecum. A picture was taken at the level of
the cecum and the colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn. After the procedure
was done, the colonoscope was removed, and the patient was returned to the
recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications.
