The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual
manner. Circumferential proximal incisions were made on the foreskin and
dissected down to the underlying tissue. Hemostasis was obtained with a
needlepoint Bovie. The foreskin was dissected sharply off of the shaft of the
penis. Hemostasis controlled. The proximal and distal penile coronal skin was
reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut in interrupted fashion. 0.25% Marcaine
was used around the base of the penis for a pain block postoperatively and
Vaseline soaked gauze wrapped around the penis loosely as a dressing.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in
stable condition.
