S - This patient has reoccurring ingrown infected toenails. He presents
today for continued care.

O - On examination, the left great toenail is ingrown on the medial and
lateral toenail border. The right great toenail is ingrown on the lateral nail
border only. There is mild redness and granulation tissue growing on the
borders of the toes. One on the medial and one on the lateral aspect of the
left great toe and one on the lateral aspect of the right great toe. These
lesions measure 0.5 cm in diameter each. I really do not understand why this
young man continues to develop ingrown nails and infections.

A - 1. Onychocryptosis.  
2. Benign lesions.

P - Aseptic technique was used and the medial and the lateral toenail
border was excised from the left great toe. The medial aspect of the left
great toenail was excised, the lateral aspect of the left great toenail was
excised, also the benign lesion on the medial aspect of the left great toe and
the benign lesion growing on the lateral aspect of the left great toe were
excised. Blood loss was less than 5 cc. Hemostasis was achieved and the left
great toe was dressed with Neosporin ointment and absorbent dressing. The
lateral aspect of the right great toenail was also excised and the benign,
which measured 0.5 cm in diameter as all 3 benign lesions did measure was
excised. Blood loss was less than 5 cc. Hemostasis was achieved and the left
great toe and the right great toe were both dressed with Neosporin ointment
and absorbent dressing. Rx Keflex 500 mg #30 sig 1 TID with food, 1 refill.
