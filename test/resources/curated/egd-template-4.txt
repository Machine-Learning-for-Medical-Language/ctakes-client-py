The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine
position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in
place during the procedure. After informed consent was obtained, the video
endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. The
scope was advanced down the esophagus and into the body of the stomach. The
scope was further advanced to the pylorus and into the duodenum. The duodenum
was visualized well into its second portion and was free of stricture,
neoplasm, or ulceration. Retroflexion view of the fundus was normal without
evidence of abnormality. The scope was then slowly removed. The patient
tolerated the procedure well.
