PROCEDURE: : Informed consent was obtained from the patient. Special
mention was made of the possibility of infection and necrosis of the heel pad.
The patient was placed in the supine position. The tender area in the medial
aspect of the heel was identified by palpation. After proper preparation with
antiseptic solution of the skin, a syringe containing 2 mL of 1% lidocaine was
attached to 1.5" 27 gauge needle. The needle was carefully advanced through
the carefully identified point at a right angle to the skin, directly towards
the central and medial aspect of the calcaneus. The needle was advanced very
slowly until the needle impinged on the bone, and then was withdrawn slowly.
The contents of the syringe were then gently injected. Subsequently, the
needle was left in place and a syringe containing 2 mL of 0.25% Marcaine and 1
mL of Depo-Medrol was attached to the needle and injected after aspiration at
this site. Subsequently the needle was removed. Pressure was applied at the
site of insertion and once it was made sure there was no bleeding taking
place, a small bandage was applied.

POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient has been asked to report to us
any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers. The patient has been asked to
restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.
