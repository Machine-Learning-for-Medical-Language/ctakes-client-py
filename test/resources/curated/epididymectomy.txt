EPIDIDYMECTOMY

OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the supine position and prepped
and draped in the usual manner. A transverse scrotal incision was made and
carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened. A small amount of
clear fluid was expressed. The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle
was brought out through this incision. The epididymis was separated off the
surface of the testicle using a scalpel. With blunt and sharp dissection, the
epididymis was dissected off the testicle. Bovie was used for hemostasis. The
vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a
nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this.
The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas
was divided with cautery also. There was no obvious bleeding. The cord was
infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum. The
testicle was replaced in the scrotum. Skin was closed in two layers using 3-0
chromic catgut for the dartos and a subcuticular closure with the same
material. A dry sterile dressing and compression were applied, and he was sent
to the recovery room in stable condition.
