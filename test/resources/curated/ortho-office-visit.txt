The patient was evaluated today in follow up evaluation. She continues to
suffer from ongoing neck and lower back pain with no recent radicular
complaints.

Her evaluation today reveals restriction in the range of motion of the
cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasms of the paraspinal
musculature. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ and
symmetrical. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the trapezius
and lumbar paraspinal musculature bilaterally.

Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. She is suffering
from ongoing myofascitis. Her treatment plan will consist of a series of
trigger point injections, which were performed today. She tolerated the
procedure well. I have asked her to ice the region intermittently for 15
minutes off and on x 3. She will be followed in four weeks' time for repeat
trigger point injections if indicated.
