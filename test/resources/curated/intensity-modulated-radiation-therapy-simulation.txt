INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY SIMULATION

The patient will receive intensity-modulated radiation therapy in order to
deliver high-dose treatment to sensitive structures. The target volume is
adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures.

Initially, the preliminary isocenter is set on a fluoroscopically-based
simulation unit. The patient is appropriately immobilized using a customized
immobilization device. Preliminary simulation films are obtained and approved
by me. The patient is marked and transferred to the CT scanner. Sequential
images are obtained and transferred electronically to the treatment planning
software. Extensive analysis then occurs. The target volume, including margins
for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected. In
addition organs at risk are outlined. Appropriate doses are selected, both for
the target, as well as constraints for organs at risk. Inverse treatment
planning is performed by the physics staff under my supervision. These are
reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by
the physician and completion of successful quality assurance.
