At today's visit, the patient's visual acuities were measured at 20/40 in the
right eye and 20/20 in the left eye without correction. Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light with no afferent pupillary defects. Extraocular
muscle movements were smooth and full. A slit-lamp examination was
unremarkable revealing well-centered posterior chamber intraocular lenses.
Intraocular pressures were measured at 16 mmHg in both eyes, by applanation. A
dilated fundus examination was performed using a 78-diopter lens at the slit-
lamp. The examination revealed non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both
eyes with dot hemorrhages and posterior vitreous detachment in the right eye.
There were no holes, tears, or detachments apparent around 360 degrees of
either retina.

A fluorescein angiogram was ordered at today's visit to rule out macular
edema. We have asked her to return in one to two weeks' time to discuss the
results of her angiogram and possible intervention and will be sure to keep
you apprised of her ongoing progress. A copy of the angiogram is enclosed for
your records.
