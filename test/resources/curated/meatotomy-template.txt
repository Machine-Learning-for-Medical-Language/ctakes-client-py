OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and was placed
in the supine position on the operating room table. A general inhalation
anesthetic was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual
sterile fashion. The urethral meatus was calibrated with a small mosquito
hemostat and was gently dilated. Next a midline ventral type incision was made
opening the meatus. This was done after clamping the tissue to control
bleeding. The meatus was opened for about 3 mm. Next the meatus was calibrated
and easily calibrated from 8 to 12 French with bougie sounds. Next the mucosal
edges were everted and reapproximated to the glans skin edges with
approximately five interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures. The meatus still calibrated
between 10 and 12 French. Antibiotic ointment was applied. The procedure was
terminated. The patient was awakened and returned to the recovery room in
stable condition.
