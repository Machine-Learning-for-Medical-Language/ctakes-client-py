PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right trigger thumb.

OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Trigger thumb release.

ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by
surgeon with local.

COMPLICATIONS: None.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the
upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was
exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg. Attention was turned
to the palmar surface of the thumb where a transverse incision was made over
the A-1 pulley. Blunt dissection exposed radial and ulnar neurovascular
bundles which were retracted out of the operative field. The A-1 pulley was
identified. The A-1 pulley was divided along its radial border, completely
freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (trigger release). The skin was allowed to
resume its normal anatomical position and was closed with interrupted sutures.
Sterile dressings were then applied to all wounds. The tourniquet was
deflated, and the patient was returned to the Holding Area in satisfactory
condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
