PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fever.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fever.

PROCEDURES: Bronchoalveolar lavage.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 28-year-old male, status post
abdominal trauma, splenic laceration, and splenectomy performed at the outside
hospital, who was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit on the evening of
August 4, 2008. Greater than 24 hours postoperative, the patient began to run
a fever in excess of 102. Therefore, evaluation of his airway for possible
bacterial infection was performed using bronchoalveolar lavage.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was preoxygenated with 100% FIO2 for
approximately 5 to 10 minutes prior to the procedure. The correct patient and
procedure was identified by time out by all members of the team. The patient
was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion and sterile technique was used to
connect the BAL lavage catheter to Lukens trap suction. A catheter was
introduced into the endotracheal tube through a T connector and five
successive 20 mL aliquots of normal saline were flushed through the catheter,
each time suctioning out the sample into the Lukens trap. A total volume of 30
to 40 mL was collected in the trap and sent to the lab for quantitative
bacteriology. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had no episodes of
desaturation, apnea, or cardiac arrhythmia. A postoperative chest x-ray was
obtained.
