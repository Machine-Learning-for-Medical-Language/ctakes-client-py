The patient is a 69-year-old female, who was referred for outpatient skilled
speech therapy, secondary to right hemisphere disorder, status post stroke.
The patient attended nine outpatient skilled speech therapy sessions from her
initial evaluation on 12/01/08 to her last session on 01/09/09.

The patient made some progress during therapy. She accomplished two and a half
out of her five short-term therapy goals. We did complete an oral mechanism
examination and clinical swallow evaluation, which showed her swallowing to be
within functional limits. The patient improved on her turn taking skills
during conversation, and she was able to listen to a narrative and recall the
main idea plus five details after a three-minute delay independently. The
patient continues to have difficulty with visual scanning in cancellation
task, secondary to her significant left neglect. She also did not accomplish
her sustained attention goal, which required her to complete tasks greater
than 80% accuracy for at least 15 minutes independently. Thus she also
continued to have difficulty with reading, comprehension, secondary to the
significance of her left neglect. The patient was initially authorized for 12
outpatient speech therapy sessions, but once again she only attended 9. Her
last session occurred on 01/09/09. She has not made any additional followup
sessions with me for over three weeks, so she is discharged from my services
at this time.
