The patient was prepped and draped. The lower lids were marked out with a
marking pen, especially in the lateral canthus. The lateral canthus was marked
out in a convenient wrinkle. The skin in the subciliary incision site was
injected with an anesthetic solution of 2% Xylocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine
along with one ampule of Wydase per 60 mL of anesthetic solution.

An orbital block was done. An infraorbital block was also performed with a 25
gauge needle. A skin muscle flap was elevated by sharp dissection down to the
orbital rim area. The herniated periorbital fat was removed by opening the
orbital septum with sharp dissection using a 15 blade, teasing the periorbital
fat out, cross clamping the fat and removing the fat with a scissor over the
clamp. The clamp was cauterized with needle cautery and then the clamp was
scarped with a 15 blade.

The remaining fat was left to fall back into the orbit. This was done in three
compartments, the middle, medial and lateral compartments. Fat was removed
from all three compartments. Then with the mouth open and the eyes in upward
gaze, the lower skin muscle flap was redraped on the eyelids and tailored to
fit exactly into place and then sutured into place with multiple 6-0 silk
sutures.

Bleeding was minimal. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
