ASSESSMENT/PLAN: MALT lymphoma. This time we need to check PET for staging
purposes. I will also schedule her for a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate. The
risks and benefits of an unsedated bone marrow biopsy and an aspirate were
discussed with her and she consents to proceed without sedation. I am also
going to schedule an EGD. I will also check a CBC, CMP and LDH. I will see her
back when I have the results of her staging studies. We will then discuss
further treatment at that time.
