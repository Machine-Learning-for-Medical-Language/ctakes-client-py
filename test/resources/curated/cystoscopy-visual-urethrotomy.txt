CYSTOSCOPY & VISUAL URETHROTOMY

OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position
and prepped and draped in the usual manner under satisfactory general
anesthesia. A Storz urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra under
direct vision. Visualization revealed a stricture in the bulbous urethra. This
was intubated with a 0.038 Teflon-coated guidewire, and using the straight
cold urethrotomy knife, it was incised to 12:00 to allow free passage of the
scope into the bladder. Visualization revealed no other lesions in the bulbous
or membranous urethra. Prostatic urethra was normal for age. No foreign
bodies, tumors or stones were seen within the bladder. Over the guidewire, a
#16-French Foley catheter with a hole cut in the tip with a Cook cutter was
threaded over the guidewire and inserted into the bladder and inflated with 10
mL of sterile water.

He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition.
