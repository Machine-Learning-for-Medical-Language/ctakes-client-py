HISTORY: This 57-year-old female who presented today for evaluation and
recommendations regarding facial rhytids. In summary, the patient is a healthy
57-year-old female, nonsmoker with no history of skin disease, who has
predominant fullness in the submandibular region and mid face region and
prominent nasolabial folds.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I do believe a facelift procedure would be of maximum
effect for the patient 's areas of concern and a "quick lift" type procedure
certainly would address these issues. I went over risks and benefits with the
patient along with the preoperative and postoperative care, and risks include
but are not limited to bleeding, infection, discharge, scar formation, need
for further surgery, facial nerve injury, numbness, asymmetry of face,
problems with hypertrophic scarring, problems with dissatisfaction with
anticipated results, and she states she will contact us later in the summer to
possibly make arrangements for a quick lift through Memorial Medical Center.
