Visual acuities at this date were measured at 20/25 in the right eye and 20/20
in the left eye with correction. Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light with no afferent pupillary defects. Extraocular muscle movements were
smooth and full. Intraocular pressures were measured at 18 mmHg in the right
eye and 20 mmHg in the left eye, by applanation. A dilated fundus examination
was performed using a 20-diopter lens with the binocular indirect
ophthalmoscope. The examination revealed retinal pigmentary epithelial changes
in both eyes with no holes, tears, or detachments apparent around 360 degrees
of either retina.

She is stable at this time and does not require any intervention at today's
visit. I have asked her to return in six months' for a followup dilated
examination, but would be happy to see her sooner should you or she notice any
changes in her vision.
