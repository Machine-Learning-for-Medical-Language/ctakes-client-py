The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner in the supine
position. We had previously asked the patient to empty her bladder prior to
the procedure. An incision was made in the umbilicus, allowing us to insert a
micro-laparoscopic trocar. We then insufflated the abdomen with approximately
3 liters of carbon dioxide gas and inserted the micro-laparoscopic instrument.
We were able then to visualize the above findings. A suprapubic incision was
then made by which we were able to place a Yoon ring applicator. With
placement of the Yoon ring applicator, Falope rings were placed at each
midportion of the fallopian tubes in the usual manner. A knuckle of white tube
was evident through the Falope rings. Video documentation was performed at
this time. With termination of this procedure then, we removed all the gas and
allowed all the gas to escape. Hemostasis was excellent. We then began closure
of the abdominal incisions. The suprapubic incision that allowed the Yoon ring
applicator entrance was closed with #4-0 Vicryl suture. The micro-laparoscopic
trocar incision was closed with a Steri-Strip. The patient was very tolerant
of the procedure. She had no complications. She was awakened and taken to the
Recovery Room in good condition.
