PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic.

PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation.

The procedure was explained to the patient and consent was obtained.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was taken to the operating room, placed
supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with
endotracheal intubation. Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus. A small
incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2
insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg and then a 12-mm
VersaStep port was placed into the umbilicus. Laparoscopic examination showed
no injury from entry. Marcaine was then injected just subxiphoid, and a 5-mm
port was placed under direct visualization for the laparoscope. Another 5-mm
port was placed just anterior to the mid-axillary line and just subcostal. The
gallbladder was grasped by its infundibulum, pulled inferolaterally. The
cystic duct was thereby splayed out. It was bluntly dissected, and 2 clips
were placed proximally and 1 distally; and it was divided. The cystic artery
was then encountered, and 2 clips were placed proximally and 1 distally; and
it was divided. The gallbladder was then taken off the hepatic fossa using
electrocautery and placed in an Endocatch bag and removed from the umbilicus.
The fascia at the umbilicus was closed with an interrupted 0 Vicryl suture. I
irrigated out the abdomen. There was no bile leak and no bleeding. The ports
were then removed. The skin of all incisions was closed with a running
Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the
case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.
