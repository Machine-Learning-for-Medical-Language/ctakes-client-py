CAUDAL EPIDURAL STEROID INJECTION

PROCEDURE: :  
1. Caudal epidural steroid injection with contrast.  
2. Utilization of fluoroscopy for confirmation of needle placement.

PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION: After being explained the risks and benefits of
the procedure, the patient signed the standard informed consent form. The
patient was placed in the prone position and standard ASA monitors applied.
Intravenous access was established and IV sedation was used. For further
details of IV sedation and infusion, please refer to anesthesia notes.
Fluoroscopy was used to identify the appropriate anatomy. The skin was prepped
and draped in a sterile fashion and sterile technique was maintained
throughout the procedure.

PROCEDURE DETAILS: The sacral hiatus was identified by lateral
fluoroscopy, and overlying skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine plain. A
22-gauge needle was used to penetrate the sacrococcygeal ligament. Correct
needle placement was confirmed by both AP and lateral fluoroscopy. After
negative aspiration, administration of 0.5 mL of the contrast revealed correct
needle placement within the sacral canal, as confirmed once again by biplanar
fluoroscopy. There was neither intravascular nor intradural uptake. An
additional 4.5 mL of contrast was administered, revealing additional epidural
flow. After negative aspiration, 17 mL of medication were slowly administered
followed by needle removal. The medication consisted of 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine
plain, plus 12 mg of betamethasone diluted in 10 mL of preservative-free
normal saline. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

POSTPROCEDURE EVALUATION: After a 30-minute recovery period, during which
no complications were noted, the patient was discharged home.
