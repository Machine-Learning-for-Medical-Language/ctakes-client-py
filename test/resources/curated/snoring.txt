CHRONIC SNORING

Chronic snoring in children can be associated with obstructive sleep apnea or
upper airway resistant syndrome. Both conditions may lead to sleep
fragmentation and/or intermittent oxygen desaturation, both of which have
significant health implications including poor sleep quality and stress on the
cardiovascular system. Symptoms like daytime somnolence, fatigue,
hyperactivity, behavior difficulty (i.e., ADHD) and decreased school
performance have been reported with these conditions. In addition, the most
severe cases may be associated with right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary
and/or systemic hypertension and even cor pulmonale.

In this patient, the risks for a sleep-disordered breathing include obesity
and the tonsillar hypertrophy. It is therefore indicated and medically
necessary to perform a polysomnogram for further evaluation. A two week sleep
diary will be given to the parents to fill out daily before the polysomnogram
is performed.
