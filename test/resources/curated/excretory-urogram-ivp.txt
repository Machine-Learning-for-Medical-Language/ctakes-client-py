A survey film of the abdomen shows no soft tissue abnormalities and no
pathologic calcifications overlying the renal contours or bladder. Following
intravenous infusion of appropriate contrast material, there is prompt
symmetrical concentration as noted by nephrograms. No filling defects of the
collecting systems are noted on the linear tomograms.

There is normal and symmetrical filling of the caliceal system. Subsequent
films demonstrate that the kidneys are of normal size and contour bilaterally.
The caliceal system and ureters are in their usual position and show no signs
of obstruction or intraluminal defects. The postvoid films demonstrate normal
emptying of the collecting system, including the urinary bladder.

IMPRESSION: Negative intravenous urogram.
