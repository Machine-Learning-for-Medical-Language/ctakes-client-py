CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right shoulder pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: XYZ has had a six-month history of some right
shoulder pain, and it has not gotten much better. She does not have a history
of trauma. It does bother her at night when she sleeps, and she is here now to
have it checked out. She has no other focal findings, no numbness or tingling
to the fingers and no soreness at the elbow or neck. She is right hand
dominant.

CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
Musculoskeletal: Reveals a positive Hawkins sign to the right shoulder with
full range of motion and minor tenderness in the rhomboids and to palpation
along the ridge of the scapula. No winging of the scapula. Internal/external
rotation is intact. No obvious signs of rotator cuff pathology or slack
lesion. Elbow and wrist exams are otherwise unremarkable. Contralateral hand
exam for comparison reveals no focal findings.

CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Right shoulder impingement.

EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: At this point, with her consent, explaining the
risks and benefits, we talked about cortisone shots. We will try some therapy,
pain medicine only as needed and a sleep aide as needed, and then followup. If
it is not better, she could consider an MRI before coming to visit and we will
reassess. We will consider a cortisone shot at that point. All questions were
answered. Therapy for shoulder impingement was outlined.
