PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopy, right upper lobe biopsies and right upper lobe
bronchial washing as well as precarinal transbronchial needle aspiration.

DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The risks, alternatives, and benefits of the
procedure were explained to the patient as well as conscious sedation and she
agrees to proceed. The patient received topical lidocaine by nebulization. The
flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was introduced orally. The patient had normal
teeth, normal tongue, normal jaw, and her vocal cords moved symmetrically and
were without lesions. I proceeded to the right upper lobe where a mucous plug
was noted in the subsegmental bronchus of the posterior segment of the right
upper lobe. I proceeded under fluoroscopic guidance to guide the biopsy wire
in this area and took four biopsies. Followup fluoroscopy was negative for
pneumothorax. I wedged the bronchoscope in the subsegmental bronchus and
achieved good hemostasis after three minutes.

I then proceeded to inspect the rest of the tracheobronchial tree, which was
without lesions. I performed a bronchial washing after the biopsies in the
right upper lobe. I then performed two transbronchial needle aspirations with
a Wang needle biopsy in the precarinal area. All of these samples were sent
for histology and cytology respectively. Estimated blood loss was
approximately 5 cc. Good hemostasis was achieved. The patient received a total
of 12.5 mg of Demerol and 3 mg of Versed and tolerated the procedure well. Her
ASA score was 2.
