CONSULT FOR PROSTATE CANCER

The patient returned for consultation for his newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
The options including radical prostatectomy with or without nerve sparing were
discussed with him with the risks of bleeding, infection, rectal injury,
impotence, and incontinence. These were discussed at length. Alternative
therapies including radiation therapy; either radioactive seed placement,
conformal radiation therapy, or the HDR radiation treatments were discussed
with the risks of bladder, bowel, and rectal injury and possible impotence
were discussed also. There is a risk of rectal fistula. Hormonal therapy is
usually added to the radiation therapy options and this has the risk of
osteoporosis, gynecomastia, hot flashes and impotency. Potency may not recover
after the hormone therapy has been completed. Cryosurgery was discussed with
the risks of urinary retention, stricture formation, incontinence and
impotency. There is a risk of rectal fistula. He would need to have a
suprapubic catheter for about two weeks and may need to learn self-
intermittent catheterization if he cannot void adequately. Prostate surgery to
relieve obstruction and retention after radioactive seeds or cryosurgery has a
higher risk of urinary incontinence. Observation therapy was discussed with
him in addition. I answered all questions that were put to me and I think he
understands the options that are available. I spoke with the patient for over
60 minutes concerning these options.
