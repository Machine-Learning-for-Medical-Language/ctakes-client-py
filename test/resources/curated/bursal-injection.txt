After the suitable risks of the injection were discussed with the patient,
including infection and elevated blood glucose levels, and there were no known
allergies to the materials involved with the injection, the patient chose to
proceed. The area was cleansed with Hibistat. Using a clean, sterile, no touch
technique, a 22 gauge spinal needle entered over the mid-trochanter with the
patient in a lateral decubitus position, the needle was advanced to the femur
then withdrawn slightly to inject 10 mL of Xylocaine 1% without epinephrine
was injected into the bursa using a 22 gauge needle. Following this, the
syringe with the Xylocaine was removed while the needle was left intact and 1
mL of Depo-Medrol 80 was injected. This was done without complications. The
patient was told that the injection may cause more pain for two to three days
afterwards and if this occurred they would best be served by icing the area
15-20 minutes every 6 hours. The patient was advised to protect the hip by
limiting repetitive bending and excessive heavy use for a week. Also, they
were asked to follow up in two weeks p.r.n.
