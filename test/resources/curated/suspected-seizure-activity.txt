Dear Dr. CD:

Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in
2005 for suspected seizure activity. He comes to my office today continuing on
Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2
years. He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point. Upon reviewing
your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his
episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider
medication use. His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time. His
Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5.

I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to
continue the Dilantin at this time. I understand this will probably entail
repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center. I await
your response and whether we should continue this medication. If you require
any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed
should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling.
