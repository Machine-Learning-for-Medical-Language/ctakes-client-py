PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION

This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed
implantation. The original consultation and treatment planning will be
separately performed. At the time of the implantation, special coordination
will be required. Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the
pre-planning process. Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on
the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning
process. Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-
plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound. Modifications will be made in
real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required. This may be
integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as
well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist.

The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and
prostate. Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid
overdosage of rectum and bladder.
