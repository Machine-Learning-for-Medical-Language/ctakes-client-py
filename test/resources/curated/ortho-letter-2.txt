Re: ABC

Dear Dr. XYZ:

ABC was evaluated today, MM/DD/YYYY, in follow up evaluation. He continues to
suffer from neck and lower back pain radiating into both arms and both legs
with numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in both arms. He had moderate relief
with his prior trigger point injections for approximately one month.

His evaluation today continues to reveal restriction of range of motion of the
cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal
musculature. The exam otherwise was unchanged. Palpable trigger points were
noted bilaterally in the lumbar paraspinal musculature.

He continues to suffer from ongoing myofascitis and his treatment plan will
consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today.
He tolerated the procedure well. He is to ice the region intermittently for 15
minutes off and on x 3 and he will be followed for repeat trigger point
injections in two weeks' time if indicated. He is to continue with his
treatment program under your care and supervision.

Yours sincerely,
