PROCEDURE: EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity
consisting of moderate-amplitude beta activity seen bilaterally. The EEG
background is symmetric. Independent, small, positive, sharp wave activity is
seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharp-slow wave discharges
seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region. No clinical
signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring.
Recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds. There is attenuation of the
background, faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is
recorded. No sustained epileptogenic activity is evident, but the independent
bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently. Photic stimulation
induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response.

IMPRESSION: EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with
independent, positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head
regions, more predominant in the right frontotemporal region. The EEG findings
are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process. Clinical correlation is
warranted.
