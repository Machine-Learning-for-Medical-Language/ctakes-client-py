SUBJECTIVE: His blood pressure up. The last two to three times he has been
in here, it has been up. He has assured me before that his blood pressure is
under good control at home, but he does not bring any blood pressures in with
him this time, which bothers me.

OBJECTIVE:  
GENERAL: Weight, blood pressure and pulse are all recorded on the chart.  
SKIN: Moist, warm, nonicteric. No obvious skin lesions that are pathological
are noted.  
HEENT: Normal cephalic. Pupils are both equal and reactive to light and
accommodation. Extraocular movements intact. Conjunctiva and sclera are clear
and benign. Tympanic membranes; no erythema or fluid.  
LIPS/GUMS: No swelling, cyanosis or ulcers noted.  
MOUTH: Normal dentition with no abnormalities noted in the mouth.  
NECK: Supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly. No abnormal neck masses.  
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.  
HEART: S1, S2 normal. No S3, S4, rubs or murmurs. No peripheral edema.  
ABDOMEN: No masses or tenderness.  
NEURO: Patient is awake, alert, oriented X 3 with no focal neurologic signs.  
Cranial nerves are intact. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Strength and
sensation are within normal limits.  
EXTREMITIES: No weakness, edema or ulcers, normal gait, no cyanosis, clubbing
or petechiae. No joint stiffness or swelling. He has surgical scars on his
abdomen and ankle.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: I am going to increase his Toprol to 100. Also he is
developing some stasis dermatitis with superficial erosions. I gave him a
prescription for some zinc oxide and told him to put gauze dressings over the
wound in the foot. I also gave him a prescription for Nizoral shampoo and
refilled his other medications. He needs to come in for his fasting blood work
as well. I will see him again in three months.
