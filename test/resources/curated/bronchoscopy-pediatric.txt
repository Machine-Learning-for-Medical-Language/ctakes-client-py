FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY

The flexible bronchoscopy is performed under conscious sedation in the
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. I explained to the parents that the possible
risks include: irritation of the nasal mucosa, which can be associated with
some bleeding; risk of contamination of the lower airways by passage of the
scope in the nasopharynx; respiratory depression from sedation; and a very
small risk of pneumothorax. A bronchoalveolar lavage may be obtained by
injecting normal saline in one of the bronchi and suctioning the fluid back.
The sample will then be sent for testing. The flexible bronchoscopy is mainly
diagnostic, any therapeutic intervention, if deemed necessary, will be planned
and will require a separate procedure.

The parents seem to understand, had the opportunity to ask questions and were
satisfied with the information. A booklet containing the description of the
procedure and other information was provided.
