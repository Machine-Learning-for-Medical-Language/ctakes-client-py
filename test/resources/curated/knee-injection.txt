After the suitable risks of the injection were discussed with the patient,
including infection and elevated blood glucose levels, and there were no known
allergies to the materials involved with the injection, the patient chose to
proceed. The area was cleansed with Hibistat. Using a clean, sterile, no touch
technique, through the superolateral approach directed medial to the underside
of the patella, 10 mL of Xylocaine 1% without epinephrine was injected into
the knee joint using a twenty two gauge inch and a half needle. Following
this, the syringe with the Xylocaine was removed while the needle was left
intact and 1 mL of Depo-Medrol 80 was injected. This was done without
complications.

The patient was told that the injection may cause more pain for two to three
days afterwards and if this occurred they would best be served by icing the
area 15-20 minutes every 6 hours. The patient was advised to protect the knee
by limiting repetitive bending, squatting , kneeling and excessive heavy use
for a week. Also, they were asked to follow up in two weeks p.r.n.
