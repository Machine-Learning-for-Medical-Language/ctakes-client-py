HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 53-year-old right-handed
gentleman who presents to the clinic for further evaluation of diplopia. He
states that he was in his usual state of health when he awoke one morning in
January 2009. He had double vision. He states when he closed each eye, the
double vision dissipated. The double vision entirely dissipated within one
hour. He was able to drive. However, the next day he woke up and he had double
vision again. Over the next week, the double vision worsened in intensity and
frequency and by the second week, it was severe. He states that he called
Sinai Hospital and spoke to a physician who recommended that he come in for
evaluation. He was seen by a primary care physician who sent him for an
ophthalmologic evaluation. He was seen and referred to the emergency
department for an urgent MRI to evaluate for possible aneurysm. The patient
states that he had a normal MRI and was discharged to home.

For the next month, the double vision improved, although he currently still
experiences constant diplopia. Whereas in the past, when he would see two
objects, they were very far apart in a horizontal plane; now they are much
closer together. He still does not drive. He also is not working due to the
double vision. There is no temporal fluctuation to the double vision. More
recently, over the past month, he has developed right supraorbital pain. It
actually feels like there is pain under his right lid. He denies any
dysphagia, dysarthria, weakness, numbness, tingling, or any other neurological
symptoms.

There is a neurology consultation in the computer system. Dr. X saw the
patient on February 2, 2009, when he was in the emergency department. He
underwent an MRI that showed a questionable 3 mm aneurysm of the medial left
supraclinoid internal carotid artery, but there were no abnormalities on the
right side. MRV was negative and MRI of the brain with and without contrast
was also negative. He also had an MRI of the orbit with and without contrast
that was normal. His impression was that the patient should follow up for a
possible evaluation of myasthenia gravis or other disorder.

At the time of the examination, it was documented that he had right lid
ptosis. He had left gaze diplopia. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light. His neurological examination was otherwise entirely normal.
According to Dr. X's note, the ophthalmologist who saw him thought that there
was ptosis of the right eye as well as an abnormal pupil. There was also right
medial rectus as well as possibly other extraocular abnormalities. I do not
have the official ophthalmologic consultation available to me today.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies any previous past medical
history. He currently does not have a primary care physician as he is
uninsured.

MEDICATIONS: He does not take any medications.

ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with his wife. He was an IT software
developer, but he has been out of work for several months. He smokes less than
a pack of cigarettes daily. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died of a stroke in her 90s. His father had
colon cancer. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete review of systems was obtained and was
negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten
notes from today 's visit.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
Vital Signs: BP 124/76 HR 101 RR 20 Wt 226 pounds Temp 97.4  
General Appearance: He is well appearing, in no distress.  
Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs.
There are no carotid bruits.  
Chest: His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION:  
Cranial Nerves: The pupils are slightly asymmetric with the right pupil
measuring about 4 mm and the left 3 mm. This is probably physiologic. They are
round and reactive to light and accommodation in the light and dark. Visual
fields are full. Optic discs are normal. Extraocular movements are intact
without nystagmus. He does report horizontal diplopia in both directions.
There is no vertical diplopia. I do not appreciate any frank ptosis. He may
have mild proptosis of the right eye, but this is the subtle at best. Facial
sensation is normal. Hearing is grossly normal. Shoulder shrug is full. There
is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness.

The rest of the neurologic examination was not completed as the patient did
not wish to continue with testing. He has a friend who is a physician, who
informed him that the shorter the amount of time he spend in the office, the
less the visit will cost him. I did explain to the patient that I would like
to conduct a complete neurological examination in order to complete my
assessment, but the patient deferred this.

IMPRESSION: The patient is a 53-year-old gentleman who developed acute
onset of diplopia that has since improved. At one point in time, he was
documented to have ptosis and extraocular movement abnormalities. There is
also question of pupillary abnormalities. My examination today is actually
fairly benign. It is possible that he had a small midbrain infarct causing a
third nerve or other palsy, although often these lesions are pupil sparing.
Myasthenia would also be something to consider, although this also does not
affect the pupil. It is reassuring that he had normal neuro imaging.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1. I do think that the patient should follow up with an ophthalmologist and
he will call today to make an appointment.  
2. I do not have any other further recommendations at this time. I will be
interested in hearing what the ophthalmologist has to say. I do not schedule
any followup, but the patient can call me back if he needs to be seen in the
future.
