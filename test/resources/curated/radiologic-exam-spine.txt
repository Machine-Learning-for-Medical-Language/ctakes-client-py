EXAM: Cervical, lumbosacral, thoracic spine flexion and extension.

HISTORY: Back and neck pain.

CERVICAL SPINE

FINDINGS: AP, lateral with flexion and extension, and both oblique
projections of the cervical spine demonstrate alignment and soft tissue
structures to be unremarkable. The vertebral bodies and the disc spaces appear
normal. Oblique views demonstrate the intervertebral foramina to be of normal
size and appearance. The odontoid view demonstrates the C1-2 structures to be
in anatomical alignment. Additional flexion and extension views in the lateral
position demonstrate normal physiologic movement with no evidence of
subluxation or fixation.

IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine study including flexion-extension
views.

THORACIC SPINE

FINDINGS: AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine, including a
"swimmer's" projection for the upper thoracic spine, demonstrate satisfactory
bony alignment. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc
spaces. No fractures or loss of normal bony architecture is seen. No
paravertebral masses are identified.

IMPRESSION: Negative thoracic spine.

LUMBAR SPINE

FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the lumbar spine demonstrate
satisfactory bony alignment with no fractures or loss of normal bony
architecture. There is preservation of the vertebral body heights and disc
spaces. No paravertebral masses are evident. There is no fracture.

IMPRESSION: Negative.
