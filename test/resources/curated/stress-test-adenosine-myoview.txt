INDICATIONS: Ischemic cardiomyopathy, status post inferior wall myocardial
infarction, status post left anterior descending PTCA and stenting.

PROCEDURE DONE: Adenosine Myoview stress test.

STRESS ECG RESULTS: The patient was stressed by intravenous adenosine, 140
mcg/kg/minute infused over four minutes. The baseline resting
electrocardiogram revealed an electronic pacemaker depolarizing the ventricles
regularly at a rate of 70 beats per minute. Underlying atrial fibrillation
noted, very wide QRS complexes. The heart rate remained unchanged at 70 beats
per minute as the blood pressure decreased from 140/80 to 110/70 with
adenosine infusion.

MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING: Resting myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging
was carried out with 10.9 mCi of Tc-99m Myoview. Adenosine infusion myocardial
perfusion imaging and gated scan were carried out with 30 mCi of Tc-99m
Myoview. The lung heart ratio is 0.34. A large transmural inferoseptal and
apical perfusion defect of severe degree noted. No evidence of perfusion
abnormality along the left anterior descending territory, which was the site
of a PTCA and stenting a year ago. The gated scan revealed paradoxical septal
motion, dyskinetic apical segment, severe inferior hypokinesis, mild to
moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis. Ejection fraction is 27%.

CONCLUSIONS:  
1. Findings consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Paradoxical septal
motion consistent with abnormal ventricular depolarization related to right
ventricular apical position of VVI pacemaker. Apical dyskinesis, severe
inferior hypokinesis, mild to moderate anterolateral and basilar hypokinesis.
Ejection fraction of 27%.  
2. Large inferoseptal and apical transmural scar.  
3. No evidence of adenosine-induced myocardial ischemia. Specifically no
reversible perfusion abnormalities seen in the territory of the left anterior
descending, which underwent stenting a year ago.
