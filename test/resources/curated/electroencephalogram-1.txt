REPORT: The electroencephalogram shows background activity at about 9-10
cycle/second bilaterally. Little activity in the beta range is noted. Waves of
4-7 cycle/second of low amplitude were occasionally noted. Abundant movements
and technical artifacts are noted throughout this tracing. Hyperventilation
was not performed. Photic stimulation reveals no important changes.

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The electroencephalogram is essentially normal.
