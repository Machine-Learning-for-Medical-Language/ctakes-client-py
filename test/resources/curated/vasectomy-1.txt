DESCRIPTION: The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped
and draped in the usual manner. The left vas was grasped in between the
fingers. The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia. The vas was
grasped with an Allis clamp. Skin was incised and the vas deferens was
regrasped with another Allis clamp. The sheath was incised with a scalpel and
elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas
deferens. The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the
vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the
proximal side. The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with
3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion.

A similar procedure was carried out on the right side. Dry sterile dressings
were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter. The procedure was
then terminated.
