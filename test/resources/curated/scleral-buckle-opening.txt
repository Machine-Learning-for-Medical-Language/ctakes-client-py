SCLERAL BUCKLE OPENING

The patient was brought to the operating room and appropriately identified.
General anesthesia was induced by the anesthesiologist. The patient was
prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A lid speculum was used to
provide exposure to the right eye. A 360-degree limbal conjunctival peritomy
was created with Westcott scissors. Curved tenotomy scissors were used to
enter each of the intermuscular quadrants. The inferior rectus muscle was
isolated with a muscle hook, freed of its Tenon's attachment and tied with a
2-0 silk suture. The 3 other rectus muscles were isolated in a similar
fashion. The 4 scleral quadrants were inspected and found to be free of
scleral thinning or staphyloma.
