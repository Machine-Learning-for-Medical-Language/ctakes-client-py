PROCEDURE: A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a
patient in the awake state. Per the technician 's notes, the patient is taking
Depakene.

The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity. Throughout the
recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave
activity are noted. The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds. The
episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation.

IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per
second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation. This activity
could represent true petit mal epilepsy. Clinical correlation is suggested.
