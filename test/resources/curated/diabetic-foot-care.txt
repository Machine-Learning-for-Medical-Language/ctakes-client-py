S - An 83-year-old diabetic female presents today stating that she would
like diabetic foot care.

O - On examination, the lateral aspect of her left great toenail is deeply
ingrown. Her toenails are thick and opaque. Vibratory sensation appears to be
intact. Dorsal pedal pulses are 1/4. There is no hair growth seen on her toes,
feet or lower legs. Her feet are warm to the touch. All of her toenails are
hypertrophic, opaque, elongated and discolored.

A - 1. Onychocryptosis.  
2. Onychomycosis.  
3. Difficulty in walking. The patients' toenails have made wearing shoe gear
painful.

P - Aseptic technique was used and the lateral aspect of the left great
toenail was excised. Blood loss was minimal. Hemostasis was achieved. Her left
great toe was dressed with Neosporin ointment and absorbent dressing. Her
remaining toenails required manual as well as electric debridement. Followup
is every three months or whenever she needs to come in.
