Monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy.

Twin A is small for gestational age but equal to twin B (size and dates is
detailed above).

Nuchal cord.

Low amniotic fluid volume.

ADDENDUM: TWIN B

After further communication with the ultrasound technologist, the small pocket
of anterior fluid is only a small portion of the volume of amniotic fluid for
the twin. Although AFI could not be determined, the single pocket meets
criteria for normal amniotic fluid.
