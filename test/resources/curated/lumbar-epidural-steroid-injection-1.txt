OPERATION: Lumbar epidural steroid injection, intralaminar approach,
seated position.

ANESTHESIA: Local and sedation.

COMPLICATIONS: None.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure risks, hazards and alternatives
were discussed with the patient and a proper consent was obtained. The patient
was placed in a lateral decubitus position and monitored with an EKG, blood
pressure cuff and pulse oximetry. The skin was prepped and draped in the
sterile classic fashion. Excess cleansing solution was removed from the skin.
Local anesthesia infiltrated subcutaneous and deep at *. An 18-gauge Tuohy
needle was then placed in the epidural space utilizing a midline intralaminar
approach with loss of resistance technique and a saline-filled syringe. Once
the epidural space was identified, a negative aspiration of the heme or CSF
was done. This was followed by an injection of 120 mg methylprednisolone
acetate and normal saline in aliquots of 2, 3 and 3 cc. Negative aspirations
were done prior to each injection. The needle was cleared with saline prior to
its withdrawal. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any apparent
difficulties or complications.
