PROCEDURE: Circumcision.

Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained.

DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and
restrained in the usual fashion. The area of the penis and scrotum were
prepared with povidone iodine solution. The area was draped with sterile
drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure. A
dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain
lidocaine. A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the
glans penis. A Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes. During this
time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade. With removal of the
clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding. The child appeared
to tolerate the procedure well. Care instructions were given to the parents.
