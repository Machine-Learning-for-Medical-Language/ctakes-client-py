The patient was consented for skin biopsy. The complications, instructions as
to how the procedure will be performed, and postoperative instructions were
given to the patient. The skin biopsy was performed on the right ankle and
right thigh.

PROCEDURE: The site was cleaned with antiseptic. A local anesthetic (2%
lidocaine) was given at each site. A 3 mm punch biopsy was performed in the
left calf and left thigh, above the knee. The site was then checked for
bleeding. Once hemostasis was achieved, a local antibiotic was placed and the
site was bandaged.

The patient was not on any anticoagulant medications. There were also no other
medications which would affect the ability to conduct the skin biopsy. The
patient was further instructed to keep the site completely dry for the next 24
hours, after which a new Band-Aid and antibiotic ointment should be applied to
the area. They were further instructed to avoid getting the site dirty or
infected. The patient completed the procedure without any complications and
was discharged home.

The biopsy will be sent for analysis.

The patient will follow up with Dr. X within the next two weeks to review her
results.
