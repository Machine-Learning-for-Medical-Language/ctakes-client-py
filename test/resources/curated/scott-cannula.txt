PROCEDURE: Placement of Scott cannula, right lateral ventricle.

DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The right side of the head was shaved and
the area was then prepped using Betadine prep. Following an injection with
Xylocaine with epinephrine, a small 1.5 cm linear incision was made
paralleling the midline, lateral to the midline, at the region of the coronal
suture. A twist drill was made with the hand drill through the dura. A Scott
cannula was placed on the first pass into the right lateral ventricle with
egress initially of bloody and the clear CSF. The Scott cannula was secured to
the skin using 3-0 silk sutures. This will be connected to external drainage
set at 10 cm of water.
