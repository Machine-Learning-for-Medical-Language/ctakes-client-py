The patient was sedated with intravenous fentanyl 75 mcg and intravenous
Versed, 5 mg, both titrated over the first ten minutes of the procedure time
to achieve adequate sedation for the procedure. Cetacaine spray was applied to
the hypopharynx for local anesthesia. The upper endoscope was passed,  
without difficulty, into the upper GI tract. The anatomy and mucosa of the
esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, stomach, pylorus, and small bowel were
all carefully inspected. All structures were visually normal in appearance.
Biopsies of the distal duodenum, gastric antrum, and distal esophagus were
taken and sent for pathological evaluation. The endoscope and insufflated air
were slowly removed from the upper GI tract. A repeat look at the structures
involved again showed no visible abnormalities, except for the biopsy sites.

The patient tolerated the procedure with excellent comfort and stable vital
signs. After a recovery period in the Endoscopy Suite, the patient is
discharged to continue recovering in the family's care at home. The family
knows to follow up with me today if there are concerns about the patient's
recovery  
from the procedure. They will follow up with me later this week for biopsy and
CLO test results so that appropriate further diagnostic and therapeutic plans
can be made.
