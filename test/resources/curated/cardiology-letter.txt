Dear Dr. CD:

Please accept this letter of follow up on patient xxx xxx. He is now three
months out from a left carotid angioplasty and stent placement. He was a part
of a CapSure trial. He has done quite well, with no neurologic or cardiac
event in the three months of follow up. He had a follow-up ultrasound
performed today that shows the stent to be patent, with no evidence of
significant recurrence.

Sincerely,

XYZ, MD
