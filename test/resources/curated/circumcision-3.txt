CIRCUMCISION

After informed consent was obtained the baby was placed on the circumcision
tray. He was prepped in a sterile fashion times 3 with Betadine and then
draped in a sterile fashion. Then 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected at 10
and 2 o'clock. A ring block was also done using another 0.3 mL of lidocaine.
Glucose water is also used for anesthesia. After several minutes the curved
clamp was attached at 9 o'clock with care being taken to avoid the meatus. The
blunt probe was then introduced again with care taken to avoid the meatus.
After initial adhesions were taken down the straight clamp was introduced to
break down further adhesions. Care was taken to avoid the frenulum. The clamps
where then repositioned at 12 and 6 o'clock. The Mogen clamp was then applied
with a dorsal tilt. After the clamp was applied for 1 minute the foreskin was
trimmed. After an additional minute the clamp was removed and the final
adhesions were taken down. Patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal
bleeding noted. Patient to remain for 20 minutes after procedure to insure no
further bleeding is noted.

Routine care discussed with the family. Need to clean the area with just water
initially and later with soap and water or diaper wipes once healed.
