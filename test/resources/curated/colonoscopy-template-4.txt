Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of
the procedure were explained. The risks that were explained were bleeding,
infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as
the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon. Conscious sedation
was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position.

A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the
cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and
ileocecal valve. This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation
was good. The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of
terminal ileum was inspected and was normal. The colonoscope was then slowly
withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed.

COMPLICATIONS: None.
