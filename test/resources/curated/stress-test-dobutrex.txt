INDICATIONS: Abnormal EKG.

STRESS TECHNIQUE: Dobutrex was infused at 10  Âµg/kg/minute increasing in
three-minute intervals. Maximum heart rate was 113. No significant EKG changes
noted.

NARRATIVE: Uptake of radioisotope was adequate in all views. There was an
inferior abnormality noted in the short axis view from 4:00-6:30. In the
vertical long axis view, there was an inferior abnormality with minimal
improvement. The horizontal long axis view had a lateral apical abnormality
with no change.

WALL MOTION: The left ventricle was of normal size and motion. All wall
segments moved normally.

EJECTION FRACTION: 72%.

CONCLUSIONS:  
1. Negative Dobutrex stress test.  
2. Normal wall motion and ejection fraction.  
3. Abnormal nuclear scan consistent with possible underlying ischemic heart
disease. Clinical correlation suggested.
