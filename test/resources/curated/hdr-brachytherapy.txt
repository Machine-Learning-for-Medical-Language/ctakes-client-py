HDR BRACHYTHERAPY

The intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and
secured after the patient was identified. Simulation films were obtained,
documenting its positioning. The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was
accomplished utilizing the CT derived data. A treatment plan was selected
utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter. The patient was
taken to the treatment area. The patient was appropriately positioned and the
position of the intracavitary device was checked. Catheter length measurements
were taken. Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were
also performed. The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device.
The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the
brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication. The
brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe
within the device. Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller
counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and
the results were deemed appropriate.

Following completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed
without difficulty. The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged
home.
