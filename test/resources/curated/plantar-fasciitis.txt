S - A 44-year-old, 250-pound male presents with extreme pain in his left
heel. This is his chief complaint. He says that he has had this pain for about
two weeks. He works on concrete floors. He says that in the mornings when he
gets up or after sitting, he has extreme pain and great difficulty in walking.
He also has a macular blotching of skin on his arms, face, legs, feet and the
rest of his body that he says is a pigment disorder that he has had since he
was 17 years old. He also has redness and infection of the right toes.

O - The patient apparently has a pigmentation disorder, which may or may
not change with time, on his arms, legs and other parts of his body, including
his face. He has an erythematous moccasin-pattern tinea pedis of the plantar
aspects of both feet. He has redness of the right toes 2, 3 and 4. Extreme
exquisite pain can be produced by direct pressure on the plantar aspect of his
left heel.

A - 1. Plantar fasciitis.  
2. Tinea pedis. There is the possibility this patient has tinea purpura.

Celestone, Soluspan. The left foot and ankle were strapped and taped. The
