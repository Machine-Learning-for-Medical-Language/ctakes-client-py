The patient was prepared and draped in the usual sterile manner for an
abdominal procedure. An incision was made as noted above in the findings and
carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, muscular fascia and peritoneum.
Once inside the abdominal cavity, a low cervical transverse incision was made
in the lower uterine segment after creating a bladder flap by both blunt and
sharp dissection. With creation of the bladder flap, a transverse incision was
made and the infant was delivered as a vertex. The placenta was then removed
as well. With removal of the placenta and baby, cord blood was obtained. The
infant was handed off to the nurses in attendance. The uterus was then
exteriorized and brought out through the abdominal incision. We then closed
the uterine incision in the usual manner with #1 Chromic suture in a running
continuous manner. The bladder flap was inspected for hemostasis and closed
with #2-0 Chromic in a running continuous manner as well. We then began
closure of the abdominal incision. Number 0 Vicryl was used to close the
fascia in a running continuous manner. The subcutaneous tissue and peritoneum
were closed with #2-0 Vicryl suture in a running continuous manner. The skin
was closed as noted above. A Foley catheter had been inserted. Clear urine was
noted. The sponge count was correct times 2. There were no complications at
this point. The patient was then awakened and taken to the Recovery Room in
good condition.
