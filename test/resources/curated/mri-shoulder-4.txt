EXAM: MRI LEFT SHOULDER

CLINICAL: This is a 69-year-old male with pain in the shoulder. Evaluate
for rotator cuff tear.

FINDINGS:

Examination was performed on 9/1/05.

There is marked supraspinatus tendinosis and extensive tearing of the
substance of the tendon and articular surface, extending into the myotendinous
junction as well. There is still a small rim of tendon along the bursal
surface, although there may be a small tear at the level of the rotator
interval. There is no retracted tendon or muscular atrophy (series #6 images
#6-17).

Normal infraspinatus tendon.

There is subscapularis tendinosis with fraying and partial tearing of the
superior most fibers extending to the level of the rotator interval (series #9
images #8-13; series #3 images #8-14). There is no complete tear, gap or fiber
retraction and there is no muscular atrophy.

There is tendinosis and superficial tearing of the long biceps tendon within
the bicipital groove, and there is high grade (near complete) partial tearing
of the intracapsular portion of the tendon. The biceps anchor is intact. There
are degenerative changes in the greater tuberosity of the humerus but there is
no fracture or subluxation.

There is degeneration of the superior labrum and there is a small nondisplaced
tear in the posterior superior labrum at the one to two o
