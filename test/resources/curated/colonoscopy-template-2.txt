The tip of the endoscope was inserted in the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip
of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the
colon, through to the cecum, was well visualized. The cecal strap and
ileocecal valve were both identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp,
mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none.
