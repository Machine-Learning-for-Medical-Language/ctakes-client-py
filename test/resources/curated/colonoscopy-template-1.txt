The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above
medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as
identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The
colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic
mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. The remainder of
the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure
well without complication.
