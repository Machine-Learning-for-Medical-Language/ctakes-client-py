INDICATIONS: Chest pain.

STRESS TECHNIQUE: The patient exercised for 5.0 minutes to a heart rate of
133. ECG was normal. Patient achieved 7.0 METS.

IMAGE TECHNIQUE: The patient was injected with 4.2 millicuries of thallous
chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.

IMAGE ANALYSIS: There is normal LV myocardial perfusion. The LV systolic
ejection fraction is normal at 79%. There is normal global and regional wall
motion of the left ventricle.

CONCLUSIONS:  
1. Normal ECG stress.  
2. Reduced aerobic capacity of 7 METS.  
3. Normal LV myocardial perfusion.  
4. Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 79%.  
5. Normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.
