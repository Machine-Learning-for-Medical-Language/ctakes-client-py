ENDOVASCULAR BRACHYTHERAPY (EBT)

The patient is to undergo a course of angioplasty for in-stent restenosis. The
radiotherapy will be planned using simulation films when the Novoste system
catheter markers are placed on either side of the coronary artery injury site.
After this, a calculation will take place to determine the length of time at
which the strontium sources will be left in place to deliver an adequate dose
given the reference vessel diameter. The rationale for this treatment is based
on radiobiological principles that make this type of therapy more effective
than blade atherectomy or laser atherectomy. The does per fraction is
individualized for each patient according to radiobiological principles and
reference vessel diameter. Given that this is a very high dose rate source and
the chances of severe acute toxicity such as cardiac ischemia and machine
malfunction are present, it is imperative that the patient be followed closely
by myself and monitored for ST segment elevation and correct machine function.
