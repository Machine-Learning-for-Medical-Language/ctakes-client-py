Informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was placed in the
supine position. The Morton's neuroma was localized by careful palpation and
was found to be between the 3rd and 4th metatarsal space. The area was cleaned
and subsequently a 25 gauge needle was inserted half way between the MTP heads
and advanced in a vertical position down through the transverse metatarsal
ligament. 0.5 mL of Depo-Medrol and 0.5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine were injected at
this site after aspiration. Postprocedure no complications were noted.
Pressure was applied for a period of two minutes and a small dressing applied.

POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient has been asked to report to us
any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers. The patient has been asked to
restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.
