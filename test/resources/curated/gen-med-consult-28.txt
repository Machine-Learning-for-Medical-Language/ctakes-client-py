HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 85-year-old male who was
brought in by EMS with a complaint of a decreased level of consciousness. The
patient apparently lives with his wife and was found to have a decreased
status since the last one day. The patient actually was seen in the emergency
room the night before for injuries of the face and for possible elderly abuse.
When the Adult Protective Services actually went to the patient 's house, he
was found to be having decreased consciousness for a whole day by his wife.
Actually the night before, he fell off his wheelchair and had lacerations on
the face. As per his wife, she states that the patient was given an entire mg
of Xanax rather than 0.125 mg of Xanax, and that is why he has had decreased
