HYPERFRACTIONATION

This patient is to undergo a course of hyperfractionated radiotherapy in the
treatment of known malignancy. The radiotherapy will be given in a
hyperfractionated fraction (decreased dose per fraction but 2 fractions
delivered daily separated by a period of at least 6 hours). The rationale for
this treatment is based on radiobiologic principles that make this type of
therapy more effective in rapidly growing, previously irradiated or poorly
oxygenated tumors. The dose per fraction and the total dose are calculated by
me, and this is individualized for each patient according to radiobiologic
principles.

During the hyperfractionated radiotherapy, the chance of severe acute side
effects is increased, so the patient will be followed more intensively for the
development of any side effects and treatment instituted accordingly.
