SUBJECTIVE: The patient comes back to see me today. She is a pleasant
73-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain, lumbar
degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis, facet and sacroiliac joint
syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis primarily bilateral recess, intermittent
lower extremity radiculopathy, DJD of both knees, bilateral pes anserinus
bursitis, and chronic pain syndrome. Dr. XYZ had performed right and left
facet and sacroiliac joint injections, subsequent right L3 to S1 medial branch
blocks and radiofrequency ablation on the right from L3 to S1. She was
subsequently seen with some mid back pain and she had right T8-T9 and T9-T10
facet injections on 10/28/2004. She was last seen on 04/08/2005 with recurrent
pain in her low back on the right. Dr. XYZ repeated her radiofrequency
ablation on the right side from L3-S1 on 05/04/2005.

The patient comes back to see me today. She states that the radiofrequency
ablation has helped her significantly there, but she still has one spot in her
low back that seems to be hurting her on the right, and seems to be pointing
to her right sacroiliac joint. She is also complaining of pain in both knees.
She says that 20 years ago she had a cortisone shot in her knees, which helped
her significantly. She has not had any x-rays for quite some time. She is
taking some Lortab 7.5 mg tablets, up to four daily, which help her with her
pain symptoms. She is also taking Celebrex through Dr. S
