BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHIECTOMY

PROCEDURE: : The patient is placed in the supine position, prepped and
draped in the usual manner. Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the scrotum
was approached and through a transverse mid scrotal incision, the right
testicle was delivered through the incision. Hemostasis was obtained with the
Bovie and the spermatic cord was identified. It was clamped, suture ligated
with 0 chromic catgut and the cord above was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine
for postoperative pain relief. The left testicle was delivered through the
same incision. The spermatic cord was identified, clamped, suture ligated and
that cord was also injected with 0.25% percent Marcaine. The incision was
injected with the same material and then closed in two layers using 4-0
chromic catgut continuous for the dartos and interrupted for the skin. A dry
sterile dressing fluff and scrotal support applied over that. The patient was
sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition.
