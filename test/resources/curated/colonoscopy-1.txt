INDICATION: Rectal bleeding, constipation, abnormal CT scan, rule out

PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form.

PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in
the left lateral position and the above medications were titrated with
adequate sedation. Monitoring was provided throughout the entire procedure.
Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no
external hemorrhoids. The Pentax video colonoscope was inserted into rectum
and advanced under direct visualization, without difficulty, to the cecum,
where the cecal strap, appendiceal orifice, and the ileocecal valve were
identified. The quality of the preparation was good. The colonoscope was then
withdrawn while carefully examining the mucosa.

The colonic mucosa appeared normal with normal vascularity and haustral
markings. No masses, polyps, AVM/s or diverticula were seen. On retroflexed
view in the rectum, there are small internal hemorrhoids.

The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated
the procedure well without complications.

1. Small internal hemorrhoids.  
2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy.
