CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY FOR CURATIVE INTENT PATIENTS

This patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort
to maximize the chance of control of this cancer. The chemotherapy is given in
addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own,
but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells.
It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of
control.

During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely
monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy
drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course. It is also
important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either
chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held. This combined treatment usually
produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to
be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize
these effects. In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and
coordination with the medical oncologist. Therefore, this becomes a very time
intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.
