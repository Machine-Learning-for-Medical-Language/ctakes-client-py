PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following a barium enema prep and lidocaine ointment
to the rectal vault, perirectal inspection and rectal exam were normal. The
Olympus video colonoscope then introduced into the rectum and passed by
directed vision to the distal descending colon. Withdrawal notes an otherwise
normal descending, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion noted no abnormality
of the internal ring. No hemorrhoids were noted. Withdrawal from the patient
terminated the procedure.
