PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was placed in a prone position. The neck was
sterilely prepped using a cervical prep set. A lidocaine skin wheal was raised
over the C5-6 interspace. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was used. Loss of resistance
was obtained using hanging drop technique. This was followed by 2 mL of
radiograph contrast material which showed spread of the dye into the epidural
space. A total of 5 mL containing 4 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and 80 mg of
methylprednisolone acetate were then infiltrated. Following the infiltration,
the patient noted warming of his arms and dramatic improvement of his
symptoms. He was observed for 30 minutes and discharged home in good
condition. There were no apparent complications to the procedure.
