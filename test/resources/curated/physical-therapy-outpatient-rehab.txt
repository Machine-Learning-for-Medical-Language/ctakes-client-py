SUMMARY: The patient has attended physical therapy from 11/16/06 to
11/21/06. The patient has 3 call and cancels and 3 no shows. The patient has
been sick for several weeks due to a cold as well as food poisoning, so has
missed many appointments.

SUBJECTIVE: The patient states pain still significant, primarily 1st seen
in the morning. The patient was evaluated 1st thing in the morning and did not
take his pain medications, so objective findings may reflect that. The patient
states overall functionally he is improving where he is able to get out in the
house and visit and do activities outside the house more. The patient does
feel like he is putting on more muscle girth as well. The patient states he is
doing well with his current home exercise program and feels like pool therapy
is also helping as well.

OBJECTIVE: Physical therapy has consisted of:  
1. Pool therapy incorporating endurance and general lower and upper extremity
strengthening.  
2. Clinical setting incorporating core stabilization and general total body
strengthening and muscle wasting.  
3. The patient has just begun this, so it is on a very beginners level at
this time.

chronic back pain, weakness, and debilitation secondary to chronic pain. The
patient presents today having missed numerous appointments due to illness as
well as no shows. The patient does feel he is benefiting currently from ___
with increased ability to leave home and visit outside the home, thus feel
