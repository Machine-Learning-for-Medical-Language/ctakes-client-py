Informed consent was obtained from the patient. The volar aspect of the left
wrist was prepared with Betadine and alcohol and rested at a 45 degree angle
on a rolled-up towel. The palmaris longus tendon was identified and marked and
so was the distal wrist crease. A 25 gauge needle was used to enter the carpal
tunnel, approximately 1/2 inch proximal to the distal wrist crease and ulnar
to the palmaris longus tendon. Paresthesias were elicited in the median nerve
distribution. The needle was withdrawn and reinserted slightly laterally
without elicitation of further paresthesias. The needle was advanced through
the carpal tunnel without any difficulty. 1 mL of triamcinolone was injected
after aspiration. The medications flowed freely without any difficulty. The
same procedure was then done to the right wrist also using 1 mL of
triamcinolone with no elucidation of paresthesias. After the procedure, the
patient clenched and unclenched the fingers of both hands for a period of two
minutes to distribute the medication. There were no complications throughout
the procedure and good relief of symptoms following the procedure.

POST PROCEDURE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient has been asked to report to us
any redness, swelling, inflammation, or fevers. The patient has been asked to
restrict the use of the * extremity for the next 24 hours.
