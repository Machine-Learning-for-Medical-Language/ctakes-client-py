OBSERVATIONS: The forced vital capacity is 2.84 L and forced expiratory
volume in 1 second is 1.93 L. The ratio between the two is 68%. Small
improvement is noted in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy. Lung
volumes are increased with a residual volume of 196% of predicted and total
lung capacity of 142% of predicted. Single-breath diffusing capacity is
slightly reduced.

IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate obstructive ventilatory impairment. Some
improvement in the airflows after bronchodilator therapy.
